# ShortwaveLogger
Logging software for Shortwave Listening

This software is for looking up and logging stations heard on shortwave.  The program includes the schedule provided by Eike Bierwirth at http://www.eibispace.de/

Using the program is simple.  The schedule window is shown on the right.  Entering a frequency and clicking search will display any stations on that frequency.  Selecting a station in the station box will display all current broadcasts from the station. Notes for the contact can be added in the notes section, and by clicking submit the contact will be saved to the disk and the history window will update with the new contact.  For people using WebSDR there is a WebSDR checkbox to differentiate WebSDR contacts.
